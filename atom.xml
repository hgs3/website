            <title>Reflecting on Confetti: Now In Beta</title>
            <link>https://hgs3.me//journal/reflecting-on-confetti-now-in-beta</link>
            <updated>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 00:00:00 </updated>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Four weeks ago, I announced <a href="https://confetti.hgs3.me/">Confetti</a> on this blog.
Two weeks ago, I shared the project on Reddit and Hacker News to gather feedback.
Today, with the release of <strong>Confetti 1.0 beta</strong>, I’d like to reflect on what I’ve learned, the feedback I received, and where the project goes from here.</p>
<h2 id="initial-reception">Initial Reception<a href="#initial-reception">#</a></h2>
<p>The initial feedback on Reddit was largely positive.
Responses came in quickly and continued for several days.</p>
<p>Hacker News, however, was silent: no comments, no votes, nothing.
I figured maybe I posted at an off time or there just wasn’t interest.
But — a few days later — I woke up to find my post on the <strong>front page</strong>!</p>
<p>It turns out Hacker News has a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26998309">second-chance pool</a> where moderators can manually boost promising projects that did not receive enough initial attention.
I have no insight into this process or who the moderator was who surfaced Confetti, but if you’re reading this: thank you.</p>
<p>Since sharing the project on social media, <a href="https://github.com/hgs3/confetti/">Confetti’s GitHub repository</a> has seen a surprising amount of traffic, suggesting ongoing interest.</p>
<h2 id="comparisons-with-json">Comparisons with JSON<a href="#comparisons-with-json">#</a></h2>
<p>Several users compared Confetti to JSON.
The comparison mainly revolved around typing: JSON has it, Confetti doesn’t.</p>
<p>JSON offers five built-in types: booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects — plus the special value null.
Confetti, by contrast, is typeless: it operates using strings and directives.</p>
<h3 id="types-vs-typeless">Types vs Typeless<a href="#types-vs-typeless">#</a></h3>
<p>I find the comparison with JSON interesting because, in practice, JSON’s typing doesn’t do as much as often implied:</p>
<p>Firstly, JSON lacks a schema language.
Schema validation is the responsibility of the user application.
Whether you expect an array, object, or a particular element type, you still have to validate it manually — just as you would with Confetti.</p>
<p>Secondly, when validating strings, you sometimes need to go further.
For example, checking if a string is a valid ISO 8601 or RFC 3339 timestamp requires manual validation — just as it would with Confetti.</p>
<p>Lastly, when dealing with numbers, checking if a value is a number in Confetti is as easy as comparing it against a simple regular expression.
And for booleans and null, these are just strings — “true”, “false”, and “null” — and can be verified with a simple string comparison.</p>
<p>So, in my view, JSON’s minimal typing doesn’t add much in real-world use cases.
If you <em>are</em> looking for real, schema-enforced types, then you might consider languages like <a href="https://pkl-lang.org/">Pkl</a> that support user-defined types and structural validation.</p>
<h2 id="feature-suggestions">Feature Suggestions<a href="#feature-suggestions">#</a></h2>
<p>Alongside the initial feedback, I received some thoughtful feature suggestions.
Here are a few that stood out:</p>
<h3 id="bracket-syntax">Bracket Syntax<a href="#bracket-syntax">#</a></h3>
<p>One suggestion was to use brackets to denote multi-line directives.</p>
<p>Right now, you’d use a trailing backslash:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>foo bar \
  baz qux
</code></pre></div>
<p>The proposed alternative uses brackets:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>foo [bar
  baz qux]
</code></pre></div>
<p>I found this suggestion interesting because the syntax resembles an array (minus the commas) as written in various programming languages.
It might even feel more intuitive for long directives that represent list-like concepts.
However, as interesting as the suggestion is, subdirectives can also be used to represent list-likes:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>foo { bar
  baz qux }
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, an application would treat the subdirectives and their arguments as entries in the “list”.
So, while the “array”-like syntax is interesting, I don’t feel the need to implement it.</p>
<h3 id="execution-model">Execution Model<a href="#execution-model">#</a></h3>
<p>Another suggestion was to give Confetti an execution model — essentially turning it into a programming language.
While intriguing, this is beyond the scope of what I intended for the language.</p>
<p>Confetti is, and will remain, a configuration language.
Its syntax is flexible enough to support domain-specific languages (as shown on the <a href="https://confetti.hgs3.me/examples/#_domain_specific_languages">examples page</a>), but embedding an execution model would go beyond its design goals.</p>
<h2 id="discovering-prior-art">Discovering Prior Art<a href="#discovering-prior-art">#</a></h2>
<p>On the <a href="https://confetti.hgs3.me/">Confetti homepage</a>, I compared Confetti to well-known configuration and data-interchange formats like XML, JSON, INI, and TOML.
After launching, several users pointed out other configuration languages that resemble Confetti syntax.
I’ll briefly discuss them:</p>
<h3 id="sdlang">SDLang<a href="#sdlang">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://sdlang.org/">Simple Declarative Language</a>, or SDLang, has some syntactic overlap with Confetti, but goes further than Confetti by adding types for strings, numbers, boolean and null, data/time formats, and binary data.
While they might share some syntactic similarity, SDLang is clearly closer to JSON or TOML than it is to Confetti.</p>
<h3 id="kdl">KDL<a href="#kdl">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://kdl.dev/">KDL</a> also has a surface-level similarity with Confetti, but again, it supports types and even allows type annotations.
It, too, is closer to JSON or TOML.</p>
<h3 id="tcl">Tcl<a href="#tcl">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.tcl-lang.org/">Tcl</a> is a dynamic programming language with a syntax that vaguely resembles Confetti.
However, it’s a full-fledged language with dynamic typing and an execution model.
If you like Confetti but need built-in types and evaluation, Tcl — or Lua — might be worth exploring.</p>
<h2 id="tentative-plans">Tentative Plans<a href="#tentative-plans">#</a></h2>
<p>As of this writing, Confetti is “done.”
Both the C implementation and the specification are in <strong>1.0 beta</strong> status.</p>
<p>My plan is to let the language “bake” in real-world usage for a while.
Depending on how things go, I might increment the version to <strong>1.0 release candidate</strong> in the coming weeks or months, and eventually tag a stable <strong>1.0</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="language-ports">Language Ports<a href="#language-ports">#</a></h3>
<p>The current, canonical implementation of Confetti is implemented in C11.
I originally intended to write a Python and Go port of Confetti, but I don’t personally have a need for them right now.
Authoring them would be mostly for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>With that said, <a href="https://confetti.hgs3.me/specification/">the specification</a> is complete and simple enough that anyone could write a port fairly easily.
If you do, I’d love to hear about it!</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts<a href="#closing-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>The positive reception to Confetti has exceeded what I imagined.
I’ll continue to support Confetti for the foreseeable future.
If you find bugs in the specification or implementation, please report them on the project’s <a href="https://github.com/hgs3/confetti/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>]]></content>

            <title>Confetti: The Configuration Language For Humans</title>
            <link>https://hgs3.me//journal/confetti-the-configuration-language-for-humans</link>
            <updated>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 00:00:00 </updated>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I’m announcing <strong>Confetti</strong> - a modern configuration language format intended for human editable configuration files.
Checkout its <a href="https://confetti.hgs3.me/">official webpage</a> for examples.</p>
<h2 id="why?">Why?<a href="#why?">#</a></h2>
<p>Formats like XML and JSON are <strong>data-interchange formats</strong>.
They are not great as configuration file formats as the signal to noise ratio is too high.
A missing comma or missing colon can throw everything off.
JSON, in particular, doesn’t even allow comments!</p>
<p>The biggest downside of these formats is they aren’t localization friendly.
Formats, like JSON, require the English words <code>null</code>, <code>true</code>, and <code>false</code>, and Western digits <code>0</code> through <code>9</code>.</p>
<p>Confetti is different.
Confetti lets you write configuration files in your native language.
It’s typeless and doesn’t make assumptions.
For example, you can decide whether <code>true</code>, <code>yes</code>, or <code>on</code> makes the most sense for your application.</p>
<h2 id="minimalistic-design">Minimalistic Design<a href="#minimalistic-design">#</a></h2>
<p>Confetti syntax is loosely inspired by Unix configuration files, the shell word splitting algorithm, and JSON.
I wanted the format to remain <em>typeless</em> and support hierarchical structures.</p>
<p>I designed Confetti to be extensible.
Just like how John Grubber defined Common Markdown and others have created their own Markdown flavors, I encourage others to create their own Confetti flavors.</p>
<h2 id="reference-implementation">Reference Implementation<a href="#reference-implementation">#</a></h2>
<p>I’ve written an implementation of a Confetti parser in C and its source code is <a href="https://github.com/hgs3/confetti/">hosted on GitHub</a>.
This implementation parses Confetti source <em>incrementally</em>.
It does <strong>not</strong> build an in-memory tree-representation like most XML and JSON parsers.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts<a href="#closing-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>I have zero expectations for Confetti.
Existing formats, even with their faults, are entrenched in the software ecosystem.
Nonetheless, I created Confetti because I believe it addresses real problems and I hope others will see that too.</p>]]></content>

            <title>Railgun Labs: From Vision to Reality</title>
            <link>https://hgs3.me//journal/railgun-labs-from-vision-to-reality</link>
            <updated>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 00:00:00 </updated>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://railgunlabs.com/">Railgun Labs</a> is an independent software company founded by myself in 2024.
At the time of this writing, I’ve shipped <strong>five</strong> software products with more on the way.
The company represents the culmination of several years of work and, given that this is my <em>personal</em> website, I wanted to share some of the history and philosophy behind the company.</p>
<h2 id="products-first,-business-second">Products First, Business Second<a href="#products-first,-business-second">#</a></h2>
<p>I’m a passion-driven software developer so I pick projects that I think are “interesting” rather than what will maximize profits.
Put another way, I’m a product guy first and foremost.
I love to build things.
To me, money is a tool at best and an obstacle at worst.</p>
<p>My business strategy is to create products that <em>I</em> think are interesting because if <em>I</em> have a use for them, then I believe <em>others</em> will too.
I understand this approach might yield fewer sales, so I keep my expenditures low.
I view it as an acceptable tradeoff as it allows me to feel more connected to my work.</p>
<h2 id="naming-the-company">Naming the Company<a href="#naming-the-company">#</a></h2>
<p>I named the company “Railgun” after my favorite gun from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II">Quake II</a>.
I grew up playing old-school first person shooters and the railgun always stood out as a unique weapon to me.</p>
<p>I added “Labs” after my love of early Hollywood Mad Scientist tropes (see the original Dr. Frankenstein in the 1931 movie “Frankenstein”).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Dr. Frankenstein’s Lab as seen in the film Frankenstein (1931).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a name, I think “Railgun Labs” is fun!
It conveys high velocity with experimentation which, I think, is perfect for a small scrappy tech startup.</p>
<h2 id="designing-the-website">Designing the Website<a href="#designing-the-website">#</a></h2>
<p>When designing the company website, I wanted to balance fun with professionalism.
I opted for a minimalistic, flat art style to give that <em>professional</em> feel.
I injected “fun” by choosing vibrant colors.</p>
<h3 id="early-designs">Early Designs<a href="#early-designs">#</a></h3>
<p>I was initially conflicted on how to create the balance I was looking for.
My early designs, I think, went a touch too far:</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Early website design." height="549" loading="lazy" src="/assets/early-railgun-website.png" width="964"/>
<figcaption>Early website design.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this early design, I had mostly finalized the home page layout and logo design, but the colors scheme was completely different from the final version.
In the final design, the colors are <em>vibrant</em> and <em>professional</em> and there’s a bit more humor injected.
For example, the “goto” in “GOTO Products” is a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto statement</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Final company website design." height="988" loading="lazy" src="/assets/final-railgun-website.png" width="1403"/>
<figcaption>Final company website design.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Websites are always an ongoing project.
I anticipate that I will refresh the design from time-to-time.</p>
<h3 id="designing-a-mascot">Designing a Mascot<a href="#designing-a-mascot">#</a></h3>
<p>Not too many tech companies have a mascot.
The choice to have one was motivated by my desire to create a strong brand identity as well as a sense of playfulness.</p>
<p>The mascot was initially based on the appearance of Doctor Tomoe from the anime <em>Sailor Moon</em>.
I wasn’t too big of an anime fan when I was younger.
My viewing was limited to Pokémon and whatever aired on Toonami, but the design of Doctor Tomoe always stuck with me.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Doctor Tomoe." height="333" loading="lazy" src="/assets/tomoe.jpg" width="394"/>
<figcaption>Doctor Tomoe.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>My initial design of the mascot was very reminiscent of Doctor Tomoe.
I think the influence is fairly obvious, once pointed out.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Early mascot design." height="441" loading="lazy" src="/assets/early-mascot-design.png" width="335"/>
<figcaption>Early mascot design.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As I iterated on the design, I toned it down, along with the website, to present the more professional look I was after.
As I approached the final design, I gave the mascot a name: <strong>Dr. Chip Codewell</strong>.
He represents my commitment to innovation.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Final mascot design." height="383" loading="lazy" src="/assets/final-mascot-design.png" width="260"/>
<figcaption>Final mascot design.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Like the website, I expect Chip to continue to undergo refreshes from time-to-time.</p>
<h2 id="product-pricing">Product Pricing<a href="#product-pricing">#</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to pricing my products and services, I wish I could say there was some master strategy or scientific equation I used, but I mostly just reviewed what competitors in the same space were offering and based my prices on theirs.
I also gauged how “expensive” it would be to replicate my work and set my prices lower to make my offerings more appealing.</p>
<h2 id="marketing">Marketing<a href="#marketing">#</a></h2>
<p>I’m not a big social media person, but for marketing I’m relying on it.
I am tentatively planning to attend various, in-person venues in the future.
And my direct outreach to various tech companies has begun.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42423988">post announcing Unicorn</a> reached the front page of Hacker News.
I attribute the success to <em>when</em> I posted: I made the announcement early-mid December when, I think, a non-negligible amount of people were out on vacation for the Holidays and new content was slow thereby making it “easier” for me to get noticed.</p>
<h2 id="an-ongoing-adventure">An Ongoing Adventure<a href="#an-ongoing-adventure">#</a></h2>
<p>Railgun Labs is an ongoing venture for me.
I’m not sure where it will lead, but I don’t regret the decision to quit my job to pursue it.
I plan to continue posting meta updates here as well as other insights as I continue this journey.</p>]]></content>

            <link>https://hgs3.me//journal/hello-world</link>
            <updated>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 00:00:00 </updated>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, everyone!
I’m Henry and this is my personal website.
I decided to create a personal website to collect my work, writing and thoughts in a common place.
I <em>could</em> spend the remainder of this post introducing myself, but I think my <a href="/about">about page</a> does a good job of that.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-this-website">Goals for this Website<a href="#goals-for-this-website">#</a></h2>
<p>My intentions are to write about my personal projects, thoughts on technology, and my other hobbies (movies, games, music, etc).
I started my own independent software company not too long ago so I intend to share my experience as a budding technopreneur.</p>
<h2 id="subscribe-for-updates">Subscribe for Updates<a href="#subscribe-for-updates">#</a></h2>
<p>I’m not a fan of centralization, much less so when it comes to online communication.
You won’t find me on X or Bluesky.
If you’re interested in following my progress, you can subscribe with your RSS or Atom reader of choice.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts<a href="#closing-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>I am not a chronically online person and I avoid traditional social media.
I don’t consume news or much media outside of my interests.
As a result, you might find my perspectives a bit outside the norm.
Nonetheless, I hope you’ll find my writings, at the very least, amusing.</p>]]></content>
